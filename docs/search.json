After completing high school in my hometown, I pursued my undergraduate studies in Statistics at Michigan State University in the United States. Upon graduation, I returned to Chongqing and worked for several years before deciding to further my education in Canada, where I am currently enrolled in the Master of Data Science in Computational Linguistics (MDS-CL) program at the University of British Columbia.\nI have a solid foundation in programming, with proficiency in R, Python, and C++, along with basic knowledge of Golang. My previous role as a Solutions Engineer provided me with extensive experience in data center operations, including virtualization, containerization, migration, backup, disaster recovery, and full-stack management.\nAs a lifelong learner and explorer, I am passionate about embracing new challenges and continuously developing my skills. It’s a pleasure to meet you."
