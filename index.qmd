## Who is Lingsong?

For programming languages, I'm familiar with R, Python, and C++, plus basic Golang. From previous intensive working experience as a solution engineer, I'm also familiar with Virtualization, Container, Migration, Backup, Disaster Recovery, and Full stack management for Data Center.

Inherently curious and committed to lifelong learning, I am eager to engage with and tackle new challenges continuously.
